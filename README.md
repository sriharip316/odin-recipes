# Recipe Website

This project is a basic recipe website to practice HTML skills. The website consists of a main index page with links to a few recipes. The primary goal is to build your HTML knowledge, and we will revisit this project in the future to style it with CSS.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main index page with links to the recipes.
- `recipes/`: A directory containing individual recipe pages.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the main page.

## Future Enhancements

- Add CSS to style the website.
- Include more recipes.
- Improve the layout and design.
